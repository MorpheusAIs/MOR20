## MOR20 TL;DR
- Any project inside or even outside the context of Web3 & AI, can use MOR20 to bootstrap their project with the click of a button.
- The use the MOR20 Smart Contracts to collect stETH in order to provide Automated Recurring Revenue (ARR) to the project is a compelling new framework
- Easily create a fair launch for projects, fair price discovery mechanism and access the large network effect of the Morpheus community.
- This model can be extended to many software as a service projects as a means of building recurring revenue / payments from users via yield.
- stETH is currently generating about 3.5% yield APR. Of that 3.5%, the MOR20 platform keeps 0.35% with the remaining 3.15% yield flowing to the MOR20 project.
- This yield collected is added to the Morpheus Protocol Liquidity and provides on going support for further Dashboards, Smart Contract development and audits.
- This adds to the Network Effect of Morpheus when it comes to bootstraping new projects, growing liquidity for all MOR20 Smart Contract users.

## Github Repo / MOR20 Smart Contracts In Development
Open source developers are updating these Smart Contracts right now so anyone can leverage them for their own project, as outlined in MRC20.  A new placeholder repo has been set up for where the MOR20 Smart Contracts will be uploaded.

There is now a dedicated channel on Discord for those interested in using Morpheus to conduct a Fair Launch using MOR20. Join in.

## MOR20 Page on Mor.org 
Mor.org is one of the most popular Morpheus community websites has added a page dedicated to the MOR20 Smart Contracts.
For all those that want to do a Fair Launch for their project, these are known as the MOR20 Smart Contracts.
There is a sign up form for those that want to contact developers directly or receive more information when the Smart Contracts are updated.

MOR20 FAQs from the community.
Timelines (audit, dashboard, documentation).

A. MOR20 Smart Contracts are ready now.
B. Audit is expected to be complete May 31st (in about 10 days).
C. Dashboard for MOR20 is expected May 24th (in about 3 days).

Customization. Are there hard requirements?

MOR20 is very flexible. A project launching a MOR20 Fair Launch can set the amount of tokens, emissions time curve, the types of groups rewarded, and so forth to what ever they want.

Will the Morpheus help with promo?
The Morpheus community acting as individuals can choose to support any project they want. Obviously the Morpheus community has proven a strong interest in supporting open source fair launched projects. You can see some of the projects using Morpheus on the community website: https://mor.org/ecosystem

Why should a project pay fees to Morpheus?
Presuming this is a reference to: https://mor.org/MOR20
"The Morpheus platform charges only 0.35% (35 basis points) of the stETH yield collected by projects using the MOR20 Smart Contracts / Dashboards." 
This value flows back into the Morpheus Protocol Owned Liquidity and thus supports more Smart Contract development, Dashboards, Audits and Frontends for MOR20. Anyone could cut out this fee, but then they would break the audits and lose access to the rest of the ecosystem.

Can the buckets be limited in time? (for one year, for example)
Yes. MOR20 doesn't set any limits to how the project sets its variables. 

Can a project use MOR20 only as one of several funding ways.
MOR20 is agnostic to the way projects who use it are built, they are free to adapt it to their needs.

What will be if a project dissatisfied with amount of provided capital compared to amount of distributed tokens and decides to suspend distribution.
Its always possible that a project would fail or stop, then Capital Providers can simply withdraw their stETH. 

Are the contracts upgradable?
There is an OPTION for the MOR20 to be upgradable or receive fixes from the MOR20 Factory Contracts, however projects can "Freeze" their Smart Contract and decide case by case if they want to upgrade.

Should a project launch on Arbitrum or any EVM chain?
MOR20 is chain agnostic. Layer Zero and Wormhole support many EVMs and Solana.

How to make sure a project doesn't add any malicious code when deploy?
Deploying a MOR20 requires NO changes to the standard code. So any real project using MOR20 will have code that matches the Reference Implementation and audits.
