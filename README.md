## MOR20 Basics
- Any project inside or even outside the context of Web3 & AI, can use MOR20 to bootstrap their project with the click of a button.
  
- The use of MOR20 Smart Contracts to collect yield-generating assets creates Automated Recurring Revenue (ARR), which is compelling for both projects and capital providers.
  
- Easy creation of fair launch for projects, fair price discovery mechanism and access the large network effect of the Morpheus community.
  
- The model can be extended to many software as a service projects as a means of building recurring revenue / payments from users via yield.
  
- stETH is currently generating about 3.5% yield APR. Of that 3.5%, the MOR20 platform keeps 0.35% with the remaining 3.15% yield flowing to a project that use MOR20 Smart Contracts.
  
- This yield collected is added to the Morpheus Protocol owned Liquidity and provides on going support for ecosystem.
  
- This adds to the Network Effect of Morpheus when it comes to bootstraping new projects, growing liquidity for all MOR20 Smart Contract users.

## Introduction
Morpheus introduced the Techno Capital Machine (TCM) to revolutionize how developers are rewarded for their software. TCM automates infrastructure and payments and is central to Morpheus's Fair Launch approach. The TCM model, validated with over $500 million in capital contributions, simplifies the creation of native tokens and supports long-term project development through Protocol owned Liquidity and fair price discovery mechanism. Morpheus's open-source MOR20 smart contracts enable easy, permissionless project launches, fostering a frictionless environment for decentralized and open-source innovation.




## Github Repo / MOR20 Smart Contracts In Development
Open source developers are updating these Smart Contracts right now so anyone can leverage them for their own project, as outlined in MRC20.  A new placeholder repo has been set up for where the MOR20 Smart Contracts will be uploaded.

There is now a dedicated channel on Discord for those interested in using Morpheus to conduct a Fair Launch using MOR20. Join in.

## MOR20 Page on Mor.org 
Mor.org is one of the most popular Morpheus community websites has added a page dedicated to the MOR20 Smart Contracts.
For all those that want to do a Fair Launch for their project, these are known as the MOR20 Smart Contracts.
There is a sign up form for those that want to contact developers directly or receive more information when the Smart Contracts are updated.

Customization. Are there hard requirements?
MOR20 is very flexible. A project launching a MOR20 Fair Launch can set the amount of tokens, emissions time curve, the types of groups rewarded, and so forth to what ever they want.

Will the Morpheus help with promo?
The Morpheus community acting as individuals can choose to support any project they want. Obviously the Morpheus community has proven a strong interest in supporting open source fair launched projects. You can see some of the projects using Morpheus on the community website: https://mor.org/ecosystem
